# PhantomJS demo

## Synopsis
This is a pdf report prototype developed using PhantomJS. The end goal is to create a html template that includes auto-generated chart and table components through data calls.

## Notes
  - I'm currently working with Bootstrap v3.3.7 for quick templating but the @media print settings removes a lot of styling once I try to render a pdf. The current workaround is to comment out the offending code but I may want to compile my own version of Bootstrap.
